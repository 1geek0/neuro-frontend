    title: "Navigating Meningioma: A Teacher's Journey to Brain Health",
    rawText:
      "A 46-year-old teacher began experiencing frequent headaches, blurred vision, and occasional memory lapses over a year. Initially attributing the symptoms to stress, she decided to seek medical attention after her symptoms became more severe and noticeable, particularly affecting her ability to focus and communicate effectively. An MRI scan revealed a small, benign meningioma pressing against the frontal lobe of her brain. While generally non-cancerous, its location posed risks that needed to be addressed to prevent further neurological issues. After consulting with a neurosurgeon, the decision was made to proceed with surgery to remove the tumor. The surgery was successful, followed by a week of hospital recovery and ongoing physical and cognitive therapy to regain full functionality. The experience highlighted the importance of recognizing early warning signs and seeking medical advice. With support from her community and family, the teacher recovered and returned to her work with a renewed commitment to promoting brain health and awareness. This story serves as a testament to resilience and the value of early detection in managing health challenges effectively.",

      "Navigating a Meningioma Journey: One Patient's Experience and Recovery",
    rawText:
      "Hello, I’m writing this to try and help people by giving information on my own experiences with a meningioma tumour I recently was diagnosed with and had removed. I'm hoping this will help people, by putting things on reddit, which can be a great place for information. My experiences will likely differ from your own. So here is some background information on me to add context. I am Male, mid 30’s and live in the UK. My treatment was performed by the NHS. Around a year ago (November 2019) I began to have some dizzy spells and by February 2020 I had passed out twice. At this point we believed I had a problem with low blood pressure and was put on tablets to fix this. But there was no change. I asked for an MRI scan after a number of months of being on blood pressure tablets with no change to my dizzy spells. I had an MRI Scan in August of 2020 and was called back that day by a doctor at the hospital. They explained to me that I had a type of Tumour of the Meninges, this is the outer protective layer of your brain. They explained that these were normally benign and slow-growing and that the Neurology department would meet in a few weeks to discuss my case and whether to operate or use a “wait and see” policy to see if my symptoms worsened. It’s worth noting here that the position of my tumour was on the left-hand side of my head. I suffered from tinnitus and had some tenderness to the skull on that side above my ear, I also had hearing loss. The problem with this and why I thought nothing of it is because my mother was born deaf in that left ear and my sister was born entirely deaf. I had always put any issues with that ear and, indeed, that side of my head/skull down to my genetics inherited from my mother. As it turned out, the tenderness I had been feeling was actually that the tumour had exerted pressure on my skull (actually damaging it) and the tinnitus was also a symptom of the tumour pressing on that side of the skull. Interestingly my doctors were unsure if the dizziness at that point was actually being caused by the tumour. In October it was decided that surgery would be needed as my tumour (whilst thin) was fairly spread out and quite large. I can only estimate give the previous symptoms I had been living with regarding the skull tenderness and tinnitus around my ear that I had actually been living with this Tumour for at least 7 years. With very little effect on my day to day, other than the aforementioned symptoms that I believed to be just due to my genetics. If you’re reading this in the future then you will know that 2020 was a dumpster fire of a year because of Covid, hopefully, that’s over now, who knows? It’s currently December 2020 for future context. Covid, however, meant that I had to isolate and that I would also be unable to see any of my family in the hospital or my girlfriend. This changed however as it was deemed that I would be unable to isolate properly due to sharing accommodation with a housemate that could not isolate, I was allowed to see my girlfriend twice at the hospital, but not my family. My operation date changed from November 18th, to November 19th. Then to December 4th. Then back to November 19th, which I found out 2 days before and had to be in the hospital the evening before for Covid Tests and blood works. I then proceeded to try and get a good nights sleep, which was absolutely not possible. In the morning I was spoken to by the surgeons assistant who told me 1 hour before my surgery that they believed my skull (which was to have a bit removed to accommodate the op) was too damaged to be put back in and they were going to put a titanium plate in instead. This was a shock as you can imagine. An hour later I was down in the surgery room and having my general anaesthetic. I have no memory of even falling asleep. My next memory is being in the recovery room and seeing the monitors and instruments. I was there for around an hour before being moved to my ward. My family and girlfriend were notified that they had removed everything that they could see of the tumour. Over the next few days I struggled a fair chunk with my speech, not in that I couldn’t speak, but more in that I could not find words and where they should go in conversations. For example, 2 days after the surgery they asked me about where my Girlfriend lived in London and all I could get out was “the nice bit” I was trying to say Islington (and actually the bit of Islington she lives in isn’t actually that nice) But I associated it with some big houses in the area that I liked so Islington became “the nice bit”. I also struggled with where I lived, I knew where I lived, I could picture it, I could show you where it was, but I could not bring to mind what it was called. I began to get quite frustrated. This began to calm after a few days and I began to remember things that I had been unable to recall/say. Whenever something new came back (like Islington) I grasped on to it and said it over and over to make sure it stuck. Within 5 days of the operation my speech was essentially back to normal. I actually went home 4 days after the operation as they explained they like people to get home as it helps with recovery and memory. 2 weeks after the operation I was still getting pretty tired, pretty quickly, but my staples needed to be removed. They were actually removed fairly easily. Post-op symptoms have included swelling in the area (to a point where I could see the fluid between my new titanium skull plate and my skin move when poked). Sinus problems like hearing fluid in my sinus, almost like having a very bad cold. A lovely scar that curves on the left side of my head around the top of my ear and toward the back (my girlfriend thinks it’s kinda sexy). Tiredness, which has come in waves, but hasn’t been too bad. Itchy scalp, a given with such a big scar and the area having hair regrow. I also have a loss of feeling/sensation around the scar area. All of these symptoms are normal. So what now and why write this? Well, now I have a scan in a few months. I will then have a scan 6 months after that and then every year for the foreseeable future. My type of tumour was a Meningioma and came back from its biopsy as benign (around 90% of Meningioma are benign). All these types of tumours have the possibility of coming back, I believe between 30-40% can come back in some capacity. They believe they got it all, but you can never truly know as you are dealing with things at a cellular level. There are different grades that the Meningioma can be if benign. Grade 1 and grade 2. If you're unlucky and fall in to that 30-40% that come back, then a Grade 1 has a chance of coming back over a 10 year period. Grade 2 its more like 5 years. Mine is Grade 2. Hopefully it doesn’t come back, but if it does then I know I have got through it before and did so in a time of Covid and with an inability to see many of my loved ones in person. You can get through it too, you’re stronger than you know. If you feel like opening a dialogue with me and have questions, then do feel free to. I will be there for you to try and help you as best I can.",
